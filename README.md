# Impractical Python 

This repo is a collection of scripts and files of various projects guided by the book Impractical Python Projects by Lee Vaughan (ISBN-13: 9781593278908). Some of the material files are imported from The Github repo of the book author (https://github.com/rlvaugh/Impractical_Python_Projects) 

Some of the scripts are slightly different from the original repo as I modified them while learning to work on python projects.
